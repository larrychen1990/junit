It's encouraging how many people come by the github site or mailing list who just say "I love JUnit, how can I help"?  If you have a specific idea, please come by the mailing list at junit@yahoogroups.com, and let's chat about it.

If you're just wanting to contribute some time, here's some ways to get started:

- Find an issue to work on.  Start with the issues at https://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues?direction=asc&labels=lowhanging&page=1&sort=updated&state=open, which are tasks that we have explicitly guessed are unlikely to get bogged down in project controversy or design debates.

- If nothing looks reasonable there, go all through the issues on https://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues?direction=asc&sort=updated&state=open, and see if there's any that tickle your fancy.  I'd strongly recommend pinging the issue with a little "hey, is this a good idea" before digging in--we will see it, and usually respond quickly.

- We're still catching up with documentation at https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki.  If there's anything you can think of to add (https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Getting-started could use some pointers to "next steps", for example), that might help the community more than additional code.
