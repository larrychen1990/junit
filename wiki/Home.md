##  JUnit Usage and Idioms
* [[Assertions]] - your bread and butter for unit testing
* [[Test Runners]] - how tests should be executed
* [[Aggregating tests in Suites]] - how to combine multiple related tests into a test suite
* [[Test Execution Order]] - specifying what order to run unit tests
* [[Exception Testing]] - how to specify expected exceptions in unit tests
* [[Matchers and assertThat]] - how to use Hamcrest matchers and more descriptive assertions
* [[Ignoring Tests]] - how to disable test methods or classes
* [[Timeout for Tests]] - how to specify maximum execution times for tests
* [[Parameterized Tests]] - writing tests that can be executed multiple times with different parameter values
* [[Assumptions with Assume]] - similar to assertions, but without making tests fail
* [[Rules]] - stop extending abstract test classes and start writing test rules
* [[Theories]] - write tests that are more like scientific experiments using randomly generated data
* [[Test Fixtures]] - specify set up and clean up methods on a per-method and per-class basis
* [[Categories]] - group your tests together for easier test filtering
* [[Use with Maven]] - how to use JUnit with your Maven build
* [[Use with Gradle]] - how to use JUnit with your Gradle build
* [[Multithreaded code and Concurrency]] - basic ideas behind testing concurrent code
* [[Java contract test helpers]]
* [[Continuous Testing]]

##  Third-party extensions

* [[Custom Runners]]
* [net.trajano.commons:commons-testing for UtilityClassTestUtil](http://site.trajano.net/commons-testing/) per #646
* [System Rules](http://stefanbirkner.github.io/system-rules) – A collection of JUnit rules for testing code that uses java.lang.System.
* [JUnit Toolbox](https://junit-toolbox.googlecode.com/) - Provides runners for parallel testing, a `PoolingWait` class to ease asynchronous testing, and a `WildcardPatternSuite` which allow you to specify wildcard patterns instead of explicitly listing all classes when you create a suite class.
* [junit-quickcheck](https://github.com/pholser/junit-quickcheck) - QuickCheck-style parameter suppliers for JUnit theories. Uses [junit.contrib's version of the theories machinery](https://github.com/junit-team/junit.contrib/tree/master/theories), which respects generics on theory parameters.
