*(As new features get added to 4.12, please link commits or pull requests here with a short description of the change.)*

## [Pull request #879:] (https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/879) Add the default 'Implementation-*' headers to the manifest

The default Maven style 'Implementation-*' headers are now present in the manifest. Example:
```
Implementation-Vendor: JUnit
Implementation-Title: JUnit
Implementation-Version: 4.12
Implementation-Vendor-Id: junit
```

## [Pull request #876:] (https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/876) fixes [Change in behavior for Timeout Rule in 4.12 #875] (https://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues/875)

In JUnit 4.7 - 4.11 setting up a `@Rule Timeout` with value 0 would result in no timeout, consistent with `@Test(timeout = 0)`. The switch in 4.12 to using `FutureTask` for the implementation would instead cause a timeout immediately, and this change brings the behavior back in line with previous versions.

## [Pull request #823:] (https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/823) Throw TestFailedOnTimeoutException instead of plain Exception on timeout

When a test times out, a `org.junit.runners.model.TestTimedOutException` is now thrown instead of a plain `java.lang.Exception`.

## [Pull request #776:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/776) Add support for [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org)

Travis CI is a free CI server for public Github repositories. Every pull request is run by Travis CI and Github's web interface shows the CI result for each pull request. Every user can use Travis CI for testing her branches, too.

## [Pull request #742:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/742) Timeout exceptions now include stack trace from stuck thread (experimental)

Timeout exceptions try to determine if there's a child thread that's causing the problem, and if so its stack trace is included in the Exception in addition to the that of the main thread.  Feature must be enabled with a `TestRule` such as `new Timeout(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).lookingForStuckThread(true)`.

## [Pull request #716:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/716) Fix annotation collection from super classes of JUnit3 tests.

Previously `Description.getAnnotations()` would always return an empty list for test* methods derived from super classes. 

## [Pull request #702:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/702) Support more return types for the @Parameters method of the Parameterized runner.

Support the return types `Iterator<? extends Object>`, `Object[]` and `Object[][]`. You don't have to wrap arrays with *Iterables* and single parameters with *Object* arrays.

## [Pull request #542:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/542) Customized failure message for `ExceptionRule`

`ExceptionRule` now allows one to customize the failure message thrown when the test does not throw the expected exception. For example example:
```java
thrown.reportMissingExceptionWithMessage("FAIL: Expected exception to be thrown");
```
If a custom failure message is not provided a default message is used.

## [Pull request #529:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/529) `@DataPoints`-annotated methods can now yield `null` values

Up until JUnit 4.11 a `@DataPoints`-annotated array field could contain null values, but the array returned by a `@DataPoints`-annotated method could not. This asymmetry has been resolved: _both_ can now provide a `null` data point. 

## [Pull request #544:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/544) New constructor and factories in `Timeout`

`Timeout` deprecated the old constructor `Timeout(int millis)`.
A new constructor is available `Timeout(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`. It enables you to use more confortable time units like `NANOSECONDS`, `MICROSECONDS`, `MILLISECONDS`, and `SECONDS`. Examples:

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = new Timeout(50, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);`

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = new Timeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);`

and factory methods in `Timeout`:

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = Timeout.millis(50);`

`@Rule public final TestRule globalTimeout = Timeout.seconds(10);`

This usage avoids the truncation, which was the problem in the deprecated constructor `Timeout(int millis)` when casting long to integer.

## [Pull request #773:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/773) Allow configurable creation of child runners of parameterized suites

The factory for creating the `Runner` instance of a single set of parameters is now configurable. It can be specified by the `@UseParametersRunnerFactory` annotation.

## [Pull request #552:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/552) Stopwatch rule

The Stopwatch Rule notifies one of its own protected methods of the time spent by a test. Override them to get the time in nanoseconds. For example, this class will keep logging the time spent by each passed, failed, skipped, and finished test:

```java
public static class StopwatchTest {
    private static final Logger logger= Logger.getLogger("");

    private static void logInfo(String testName, String status, long nanos) {
        logger.info(String.format("Test %s %s, spent %d microseconds",
                                    testName, status, Stopwatch.toMicros(nanos)));
    }

    @Rule
    public Stopwatch stopwatch= new Stopwatch() {
        @Override
        protected void succeeded(long nanos, Description description) {
            logInfo(description.getMethodName(), "succeeded", nanos);
        }

        @Override
        protected void failed(long nanos, Throwable e, Description description) {
            logInfo(description.getMethodName(), "failed", nanos);
        }

        @Override
        protected void skipped(long nanos, AssumptionViolatedException e, Description description) {
            logInfo(description.getMethodName(), "skipped", nanos);
        }

        @Override
        protected void finished(long nanos, Description description) {
            logInfo(description.getMethodName(), "finished", nanos);
        }
    };

    @Test
    public void succeeds() {
    }

    @Test
    public void fails() {
        fail();
    }

    @Test
    public void skips() {
        assumeTrue(false);
    }
}
```
An example to assert runtime:
```java
@Test
public void performanceTest() throws InterruptedException {
    long delta= 30;
    Thread.sleep(300L);
    assertEquals(300d, stopwatch.runtime(MILLISECONDS), delta);
    Thread.sleep(500L);
    assertEquals(800d, stopwatch.runtime(MILLISECONDS), delta);
}
```

## [Pull request #566:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/566) Enables Inheritance on Category.java by adding @Inherited

`@interface Category` now is annotated with `@Inherited` itself. This enables Inheritance of Categories from Ancestors (eg abstract test-classes). Note that you are able to "overwrite" `@Category` on inheritors and that this has no effect on method-level (see [@Inherited](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Inherited.html)).

## [Pull request #503:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/503) Configurable Categories

From a given set of test classes, the `Categories` runner
runs only the classes and methods
that are annotated with either the category given with the `@IncludeCategory`
annotation, or a subtype of that category. Either classes or interfaces can be
used as categories. Subtyping works, so if you say `@IncludeCategory(SuperClass.class)`,
a test marked `@Category({SubClass.class})` will be run.

You can also exclude categories by using the `@ExcludeCategory` annotation, see `SlowTestSuiteWithoutFast`.

The suite `FastOrSmokeTestSuite` is an example to run multiple categories.

To execute tests which match all categories, use `matchAny = false` in annotations. See `FastAndSmokeTestSuite`.
 
Example:

```java
public static interface FastTests { /* category marker */ }
public static interface SlowTests { /* category marker */ }
public static interface SmokeTests { /* category marker */ }

public static class A {
	public void a() {
		fail();
	}

	@Category(SlowTests.class)
	@Test
	public void b() {
	}

	@Category({FastTests.class, SmokeTests.class})
	@Test
	public void c() {
	}
}

@Category({SlowTests.class, FastTests.class})
public static class B {
	@Test
	public void d() {
	}
}

@RunWith(Categories.class)
@Categories.IncludeCategory(SlowTests.class)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({A.class, B.class})
public static class SlowTestSuite {
	// Will run A.b and B.d, but not A.a and A.c
}

@RunWith(Categories.class)
@Categories.IncludeCategory({FastTests.class, SmokeTests.class})
@Suite.SuiteClasses({A.class, B.class})
public static class FastOrSmokeTestSuite {
	// Will run A.c and B.d, but not A.b because it is not any of FastTests or SmokeTests
}

@RunWith(Categories.class)
@Categories.IncludeCategory(value = {FastTests.class, SmokeTests.class}, matchAny = false)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({A.class, B.class})
public static class FastAndSmokeTestSuite {
	// Will run only A.c => match both FastTests AND SmokeTests
}

@RunWith(Categories.class)
@Categories.IncludeCategory(SlowTests.class)
@Categories.ExcludeCategory(FastTests.class)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({A.class, B.class}) // Note that Categories is a kind of Suite
public class SlowTestSuiteWithoutFast {
	// Will run A.b, but not A.a, A.c or B.d
}
```

## [Pull request #549:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/549) fixes for #544 and #545
[https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Timeout-for-tests](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Timeout-for-tests)
The Timeout Rule applies the same timeout to all test methods in a class:
```java
public class HasGlobalTimeout {

    @Rule
    public Timeout globalTimeout = new Timeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    @Test
    public void testInfiniteLoop() {
        for (;;) {
        }
    }

    @Test
    public synchronized void testInterruptableLock() throws InterruptedException {
        wait();
    }

    @Test
    public void testInterruptableIO() throws IOException {
        for (;;) {
            FileChannel channel = new RandomAccessFile(file, "rw").getChannel();
            // Interrupted thread closes channel and throws ClosedByInterruptException.
            channel.write(buffer);
            channel.close();
        }
    }
}
```
Each test is run in a new _daemon_ thread. If the specified timeout elapses before the test completes, its execution is interrupted via _Thread#interrupt()_. This happens in interruptable I/O (operations throwing _java.io.InterruptedIOException_ and _java.nio.channels.ClosedByInterruptException_), locks (package _java.util.concurrent_) and methods in _java.lang.Object_ and _java.lang.Thread_ throwing _java.lang.InterruptedException_.

## [Pull request #572:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/572) Ensuring no-generic-type-parms validator called/tested for theories

The `Theories` runner now disallows `Theory` methods with parameters that have "unresolved" generic type parameters (e.g. `List<T>` where `T` is a type variable). It is exceedingly difficult for the `DataPoint(s)` scraper or other `ParameterSupplier`s to correctly decide values that can legitimately be assigned to such parameters in a type-safe way, so JUnit now disallows them altogether. Theory parameters such as `List<String>` and `Iterable<? extends Number>` are still allowed.

The machinery to perform this validation was in the code base for some time, but not used. It now is used.

[junit.contrib](https://github.com/junit-team/junit.contrib)'s rendition of theories performs the same validation.

## [Pull request #583,](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/583) [Pull request #720:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/720) Fix handling of AssertionErrors and AssumptionViolatedException in ExpectedException rule.

ExpectedException didn't handle AssertionErrors and AssumptionViolatedException well. This has been fixed. The new documentation explains the usage of ExpectedException for testing these exceptions. The two methods handleAssertionErrors() and handleAssumptionViolatedExceptions() are not needed anymore. If you have used them, just remove it and read ExpectedException's documentation.

## [Pull request #611:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/611) Assert.assertNotEquals() for float parameters.

Version 4.11 added `Assert.assertEquals()` for float parameters with a float delta, and `Assert.assertNotEquals()`. This is the combination of those two features.

## [Pull request #632:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/632) Assert.assertArrayEquals for boolean[] parameters.

`Assert.assertArrayEquals()` previously existed for all other primitive classes, except `boolean[]`. This has now been added.

## [Pull request #607:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/607) Improving theory failure messages

Theory failure messages previously were of the form: `ParameterizedAssertionError: theoryTest(badDatapoint, allValues[1], otherVar)`, where allValues, badDatapoint and otherVar were the variables the datapoints was sourced from. These messages are now of the form: 
```java
ParameterizedAssertionError: theoryTest(null <from badDatapoint>, "good value" <from allValues[1]>, 
                                  [toString() threw RuntimeException: Error message] <from otherVar>)
```
## [Pull request #601:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/601) Allow use of Assume in tests run by Theories runner
If, in a theory, all parameters were 'assumed' away, the Theories runner would properly fail, informing you that no parameters were found to actually test something.  However, if you had another method in that same class, that was not a theory (annotated with `@Test` only,) you could not use Assume in that test.  Now the Theories runner will verify the method is annotated with `@Theory` before failing due to no parameters being found.
: 
```java
@RunWith(Theories.class)
public class TheoriesAndTestsTogether {

    @DataPoint
    public static Object o;

    @Theory
    public void theory(Object o) {
        // this will still fail: java.lang.AssertionError: Never found parameters that satisfied method assumptions.
        Assume.assumeTrue(false);
    }

    @Test
    public void test() {
        // this will no longer fail
        Assume.assumeTrue(false);
    }
}
```

## [Pull request #623:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/623) Ensure datapoints array fields and methods are public and static in Theory classes.

Previously if a datapoints array field or method was non-static or non-public it would be silently ignored and the datapoints not used. Now the Theories runner verifies that all `@DataPoint` or `@DataPoints` annotated fields or methods in classes are both public and static, and such classes will fail to run with InitializationErrors if they are not.

## [Pull request #621:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/621) Added mechanism for matching specific datapoints in Theory classes to specific parameters, by naming datapoints.

`@DataPoints` fields or methods can now be given (one or more) names in the annotation, and `@Theory` method parameters can be annotated with `@FromDataPoints(name)`, to limit the datapoints considered for that parameter to only the datapoints with that name:

```java
@DataPoints
public static String[] unnamed = new String[] { ... };

@DataPoints("regexes")
public static String[] regexStrings = new String[] { ... };
  
@DataPoints({"forMatching", "alphanumeric"})
public static String[] testStrings = new String[] { ... }; 
  
@Theory
public void stringTheory(String param) {
    // This will be called with every value in 'regexStrings',
    // 'testStrings' and 'unnamed'.
}
  
@Theory
public void regexTheory(@FromDataPoints("regexes") String regex,
                        @FromDataPoints("forMatching") String value) {
    // This will be called with only the values in 'regexStrings' as 
    // regex, only the values in 'testStrings' as value, and none 
    // of the values in 'unnamed'.
}
```

## [Pull request #654:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/654) Autogeneration of enum and boolean datapoints

Any theory method parameters with boolean or enum types that can't be supplied with values by any other sources will be automatically supplied with default values: true and false, or every value of the given enum. If other explicitly defined values are available (e.g. from a specified ParameterSupplier or some DataPoints method in the theory class), only those explicitly defined values will be used.

## [Pull request #651:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/651) Improvements to Theory parameter and DataPoint type matching

 * Validity of DataPoints for theory parameters for all field datapoints and multi-valued method datapoints (i.e. not single-valued method datapoints) is now done on runtime type, not field/method return type (previously this was the case for multi-valued array methods only)

 * Validity of DataPoints for theory parameters for all datapoints now correctly handles boxing and unboxing for primitive and wrapper types; e.g. int values will be considered for theory parameters that are Integer assignable, and Integer values will be considered for int parameters

## [Pull request #639:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/639) Failing theory datapoint methods now cause theory test failures

Previously `@DataPoint(s)` methods that threw exceptions were quietly ignored and if another DataPoint source was available then those values alone were used, leaving the theory passing using only a subset of the (presumably) intended input values. Instead any datapoint method failures during theory test will now cause the theory being tested to immediately fail.

This is a non-backward compatible fix, and could potentially break theory tests that depended on failing methods. If that was desired behaviour then the expected exceptions can instead be specifically ignored using the new ignoredExceptions array attribute on `@DataPoint` and `@DataPoints` methods. Adding an exception to this ignoredExceptions array will stop theory methods failing if the given exception, or subclasses of it, are thrown in the annotated method. This attribute has no effect on datapoint fields.

## [Pull request #658:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/658) Iterables can now be used as datapoints

Previously when building sets of datapoints for Theory parameters the only valid multi-valued `@DataPoints` types were arrays. This has now been extended to also take parameters from iterable `@DataPoints` methods and fields.

## [Pull request #625 (commit 72af03c49f):](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/commit/72af03c49fdad5f10e36c7eb4e7045feb971d253) Make RunNotifier code concurrent.

When running tests from multiple threads, JUnit will now call `RunListener` methods from multiple threads if the listener class is annotated with `@RunListener.ThreadSafe`. In addition, the code in `RunNotifier` has been modified to not use locks.

## [Pull request #684:](https://github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/684) Adding AnnotationValidator framework and validation checks for Category.

This allows for validation to be added to annotations. Validators should extend `AnnotationValidator` and be attached to Annotations with the `@ValidateWith` annotation. `CategoryValidator` extends `AnnotationValidator` and ensures that incompatible annotations (`@BeforeClass`, `@AfterClass`, `@Before`, `@After`) are not used in conjunction with `@Category`.
